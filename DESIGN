The most global class is Project. It is a singleton so all data that can be shared among KAider instances should go into it.

KAider is a dispatcher for one catalog editing window.
KAiderView is msgid/msgstr viewer/editor.
All specialized actions should go into views (QDockWidgets).

PS I love Qt's signal/slot mechanism.
