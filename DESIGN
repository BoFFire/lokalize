The most global class is 'Project'. It is a singleton so all data that can be shared among Lokalize windows should go into it.
'Settings' is also a singleton (src/prefs).

'KAider' is a dispatcher (controller) for one catalog editing window.
'KAiderView' is msgid/msgstr viewer/editor.

All specialized actions should go into views (QDockWidgets) or separate classes used from views.

'Catalog' is a controller+proxymodel for translation files
'CatalogStorage' is interface for different storage models (qvector for gettext, qdom for xliff)


==Translation Memory==
Implemented as series of jobs running in second thread (src/tm/jobs.cpp)
